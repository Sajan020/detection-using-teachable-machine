# ⚙️ Casting Defect Detection using Deep Learning

A Streamlit web application for real-time anomaly detection in manufactured cast metal parts. This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify product images as 'Normal' or 'Anomalous' (defective), helping to automate the quality control process in a manufacturing setting.

## 📝 Project Overview

In manufacturing, ensuring product quality is critical. Manual inspection is often slow, expensive, and prone to human error. This project presents a proof-of-concept for an automated quality control system. It uses a deep learning model to analyze images of cast metal impellers and identify those with manufacturing defects. The entire system is wrapped in a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

## ✨ Features

  * **Image-Based Detection:** Users can upload an image of a cast part for immediate analysis.
  * **Real-time Classification:** The app classifies the part as `Normal` or `Anomaly` using a trained TensorFlow/Keras model.
  * **Confidence Scoring:** Displays the model's confidence in its prediction, providing a measure of certainty.
  * **Actionable Recommendations:** Provides clear, color-coded results and a practical recommendation (e.g., "Flag for manual inspection").
  * **Informational Interface:** Includes a sidebar with project details and an expandable "How-to-Use" guide.
  * **Example Cases:** Shows example images of normal and defective parts for user reference.
